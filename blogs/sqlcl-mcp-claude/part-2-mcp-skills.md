# Talk to Oracle with Claude AI — Part 2: MCP Server + Claude Skills

In Part 1 you installed the Oracle SQL Developer extension and spun up a
Docker Oracle HR database. Now you'll wire Claude Code to that database using
the SQLcl MCP server — and install the skills that let Claude query Oracle
with plain English.

**Series:**
- Part 1: Setup — VS Code extension, Docker HR schema
- Part 2: MCP Server Configuration + Claude Skills ← you are here
- Part 3: Prompt Demos — Querying Oracle in Plain English
- Part 4: Microsoft Agent Framework — C# Agent with SQLcl MCP

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) is an open standard that lets AI models
call external tools in a structured, type-safe way. Instead of writing bash
scripts that pipe SQL through Claude's context, MCP gives the AI a proper
tool interface — with named tools, typed parameters, and structured responses.

SQLcl 24+ ships with a built-in MCP server. When Claude Code connects to it,
Claude gets direct access to tools like `sql_run`, `connect`, and
`schema_information` — no scripting glue required.

---

## Configure the MCP Server

The demo repo ships with `.mcp.json` at the project root. This is Claude Code's
**project-scoped MCP config** — it's checked into git and shared with the team.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sqlcl": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\.vscode\\extensions\\oracle.sql-developer-<version>-win32-x64\\dbtools\\sqlcl\\bin\\sql.exe",
      "args": ["-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Update the `command` path** to match your local SQLcl location (the path you
found in Part 1).

### How it works

When Claude Code starts, it reads `.mcp.json` and launches the `sqlcl -mcp`
process as a subprocess. Claude communicates with SQLcl over stdin/stdout using
JSON-RPC — the same protocol used by all MCP servers.

SQLcl runs in MCP mode and waits for tool calls. When you ask Claude a database
question, Claude picks the right MCP tool, calls it with the appropriate
parameters, and uses the response to answer you.

### Load the MCP Server

After updating the path in `.mcp.json`:

1. Open a new Claude Code session in the project directory
2. Type `/mcp` to verify

You should see:

```text
sqlcl  ✓ connected
```

> 💡 If the server doesn't appear, check that your `command` path points to the
> correct `sql.exe` inside the Oracle SQL Developer extension folder. The path
> changes with each extension version update.

## Available SQLcl MCP Tools

Once connected, Claude has access to these tools — it selects them automatically
based on your question:

- **`connections_list`** — List all saved Oracle connections
- **`connect`** — Connect to a named saved connection
- **`schema_information`** — Get schema overview (tables, object types)
- **`sql_run`** — Execute SQL queries
- **`sqlcl_run`** — Execute SQLcl commands (SET, DDL, Liquibase)
- **`disconnect`** — Close the current connection
- **`request_status`** — Check current connection status

You don't call these tools directly — Claude selects the right tool and
parameters automatically when you ask a question. The tool list is what Claude
sees; what you see is just the answer.

## Claude Skills — Plain English to Oracle

The repo's `.claude/skills/` folder contains **Claude AI skills** — pre-built
prompt templates that give Claude focused instructions for specific database
tasks. You invoke them with a `/skill-name` command in the chat.

- **`/oracle-sql-query`** — Run any SQL — data queries, analysis, custom SELECT
- **`/oracle-table-schema <table>`** — Describe table columns and data types
- **`/oracle-table-constraints <table>`** — Show PK, FK, and check constraints
- **`/oracle-table-relationships`** — Map FK relationships across the schema
- **`/oracle-search-tables <pattern>`** — Find tables by name pattern
- **`/oracle-search-columns <name>`** — Find columns by name across all tables
- **`/oracle-table-indexes <table>`** — Show indexes and indexed columns
- **`/oracle-database-info`** — Database version, schema metadata, object counts
- **`/oracle-export`** — Export query results to CSV or Excel via SQLcl SPOOL

Skills aren't required — you can ask Claude database questions directly and it
will use the MCP tools on its own. Skills give Claude focused guidance for
specific task types, which improves accuracy and reduces back-and-forth.

### What a skill invocation looks like

```text
/oracle-table-schema EMPLOYEES
```

Claude receives the skill's prompt template, connects to the database using
the `connect` MCP tool, runs `DESC EMPLOYEES` and queries the data dictionary,
then returns a formatted summary of columns, types, and nullability.

### Connect first

Before running any query, Claude needs to connect to the HR schema. In the
Claude Code chat, just say:

```text
connect to hr_local
```

Claude uses the `connect` MCP tool with the `hr_local` connection name you
saved in Part 1 — you don't type connection strings into the chat. Claude
handles the credentials from the saved connection automatically.

> ✅ Once connected in a chat session, Claude stays connected until you
> close the session or explicitly disconnect.

---

## Verify End-to-End

With the MCP server connected, run a quick smoke test:

1. In Claude Code chat, type:
   ```text
   Connect to hr_local and tell me how many employees are in the database.
   ```

2. Claude should call `connect` then `sql_run`, and return something like:
   ```text
   The HR schema has 5 employees.
   ```

If you see a live number instead of an error, the full stack is working:
Docker Oracle → SQLcl MCP → Claude Code.

## What's Next

Everything is wired up. In Part 3, you'll run real prompts against the live
HR database and see Claude query Oracle, explain relationships, and export data
— all in plain English.
